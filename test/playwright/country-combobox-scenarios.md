1. open combobox
2. hover over Afghanistan
3. down arrow three times

Expected: the fourth row is highlighted and it's not at the top of the viewport

---

When I highlight the item at the bottom of the scroll area and press the up arrow, the highlighted item is one row above the bottom row of the scroll area. 

When I highlight the item at the top of the scroll area and press the down arrow, the highlighted item is one row below the top row of the scroll area. 

Requirement:

The scroll area should not scroll unless the highlighted item is at the top of the scroll area and the up arrow is pressed. The scroll area should only scroll if the highlighted item is at the bottom of the scroll area and the down arrow is pressed.
